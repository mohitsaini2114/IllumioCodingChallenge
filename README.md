# IllumioCodingChallenge

## Testing

I uesd Junit to test my code. I have passed all the test cases mentioned in the test.

## Implmentation

Firewall.java - In this class, I'm passing CSV file and reading it. I'm storing all teh reules from CSV file to Hash Set by splitting data by comma.

Rule.java This class takes in the 4 parameters of a CSV line and creates a rule. I have createrd differnet clsses for Port and Ip Address to handle the Port and Ip Address data. I have overrided the equals method to check whether two given rules are equal or not.

## Refinements

If time had permit, I would have added validations to all the input field. I would have declared enums for all defined protocols likd TCP, UDP.

## Teams

I would like to join Platform team.
